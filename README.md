## About
&nbsp;&nbsp; In this project, I developed an expenses tracker application. The user can save all expenses in a list, selecting the currency used for the purchase. All the exchange values are automatically calculated in real-time based on the [awesomeapi currency exchange API](https://docs.awesomeapi.com.br/api-de-moedas) and converted to Real (the Brazillian currency is used as the default). My goal was to develop a page based on the requirements given by [Trybe](https://www.betrybe.com/).

- [x] Login Page;
- [x] Add, remove and edit an expense;
